# Power Apps Deployment Guide

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Dataverse environment created
- [ ] All required tables exist with correct schema
- [ ] Sample data loaded for testing
- [ ] Security roles configured
- [ ] Power Automate environment ready

### App Configuration
- [ ] All screens created and tested
- [ ] Navigation working correctly
- [ ] All formulas tested and delegation-friendly
- [ ] Color theme applied consistently
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified
- [ ] Error handling implemented

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Final Testing
\`\`\`
Test Scenarios:
- Create new case
- Update case status
- Assign case to user
- Process daily load
- Update user settings
- Generate reports
- Test all filters
- Verify calculations
\`\`\`

### 2. Performance Optimization
\`\`\`
Delegation Review:
- Check all Filter() functions
- Verify Sort() operations
- Optimize Gallery Items formulas
- Use delegation-friendly operators
- Add indexes to Dataverse tables if needed
\`\`\`

### 3. Security Configuration
\`\`\`
Dataverse Security Roles:
- Case Manager (Full access)
- Team Lead (Read/Write cases, Read users)
- Agent (Read/Write assigned cases only)
- Viewer (Read-only access)

Power Apps Sharing:
- Share app with security groups
- Set appropriate permission levels
- Configure data loss prevention policies
\`\`\`

### 4. App Publishing
\`\`\`
Publishing Steps:
1. Save all changes
2. Run App Checker for issues
3. Test in Preview mode
4. Publish to production
5. Update app description and icon
6. Share with pilot users first
\`\`\`

### 5. Power Automate Flows Setup

#### Case Auto-Assignment Flow
\`\`\`
Trigger: When a case is created
Actions:
1. Get active users with capacity
2. Apply assignment logic (round-robin/workload)
3. Update case with assigned user
4. Send notification to assigned user
\`\`\`

#### SLA Monitoring Flow
\`\`\`
Trigger: Scheduled (every hour)
Actions:
1. Get cases approaching SLA breach
2. Send notifications to managers
3. Update case priority if needed
4. Log SLA breach events
\`\`\`

#### Daily Load Processing Flow
\`\`\`
Trigger: Manual or scheduled
Actions:
1. Process pending loads
2. Create cases from load data
3. Apply auto-assignment rules
4. Send processing summary
\`\`\`

### 6. User Training Materials

#### Quick Start Guide
\`\`\`
1. Dashboard Overview
   - KPI cards explanation
   - Chart interpretation
   - Recent activity monitoring

2. Case Management
   - Creating new cases
   - Updating case status
   - Adding notes and attachments
   - Reassigning cases

3. Daily Load Processing
   - Reviewing pending loads
   - Processing individual loads
   - Bulk processing options

4. User Management
   - Viewing team workload

\`\`\`

### 7. Monitoring and Maintenance

#### App Analytics
\`\`\`
Monitor:
- Daily active users
- Screen usage patterns
- Error rates
- Performance metrics
- Data source connection health
\`\`\`

#### Regular Maintenance
\`\`\`
Weekly:
- Review app performance
- Check for delegation warnings
- Monitor data growth
- Update sample data

Monthly:
- Review user feedback
- Update formulas if needed
- Check Power Automate flow runs
- Optimize slow-performing screens

Quarterly:
- Review security permissions
- Update training materials
- Plan feature enhancements
- Conduct user satisfaction survey
\`\`\`

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### Delegation Warnings
\`\`\`
Problem: Blue underline in formulas
Solution: 
- Use delegation-friendly functions
- Filter data at source
- Use collections for complex operations
- Add indexes to Dataverse tables
\`\`\`

#### Slow Performance
\`\`\`
Problem: App loads slowly
Solution:
- Reduce Gallery template complexity
- Use concurrent functions
- Optimize image sizes
- Cache frequently used data
\`\`\`

#### Data Connection Issues
\`\`\`
Problem: Data not loading
Solution:
- Check Dataverse connection
- Verify table permissions
- Refresh data sources
- Check network connectivity
\`\`\`

#### Formula Errors
\`\`\`
Problem: Red X in formulas
Solution:
- Check column name spelling
- Verify data types
- Use proper syntax
- Test with simple data first
